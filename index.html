      "Nature is not a place to visit, it is home."
      "In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks."
      "What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?"
      "The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the way.
      Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my propositions. And some see no
      nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself."

      A river is a natural watercourse,[39] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.[40] A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).

       The during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.[68] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

      Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms
